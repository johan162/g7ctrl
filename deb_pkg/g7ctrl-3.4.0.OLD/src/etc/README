README
------
Contains configuration files that are installed in the $sysconfdir and as
service init files. Note that these files are templates for the buildsystem
since we want to do some variable substitutions in them.

The configure script will test to see if the system is using either 
Debian style init script (and if it also supports the modern upstart method 
through initctl) as well as testing for sysV5 old school init script used
in for example older SuSE distributions.

PRESETS
-------
Presets are stored sequences of commands to the device to set it up in a 
specific mode.

The user can add arbitrary presets to perform commonly used sequences of
commands.

Format of the preset files
--------------------------
<summary description>
<documentation>
<cmd 1>
<cmd 2>
..
<cmd nnn>

- Summary description
  The first line is a short summary description of the purpose of this preset. 

- Documentation
  The comment section is a more full description of the purpose with this
  preset.

  Both the summary description and the documentation section must start with
  a '#' character as the first left most character.
  
Command format
The command format is the same as the format used in the shell but with
the arguments specified as function arguments.

So for example
    
    get VER()

Corrsponds to

    $WP+VER=0000,?
 
In general

    set XXXX(n1,n2,n3,n4) 

Corresponds to

    $WP+XXXX=0000,n1,n2,n3


Example file:
#Set the device ID
#A fuller explanation is shown as a help
