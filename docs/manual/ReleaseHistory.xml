                    This is mainly an update for the build environment. The primary build environment
                    is now <command>gcc v5.4.0</command> (was 4.8.4). For the documentation to process
                    the XML files fop v2.1. is now the default (was 1.1)
                </para>
                <para>
                    The environment update has forced some minor code updates (primarily some
                    instrumentation to shut down false positive warning for use of C99 variable
                    length arrays on the stack (VLA). The move to fop 2.1 requires a configuration
                    file to set the proper base URI for inclusion of external objects (e.g. images in
                    the manual).

		<para>Note: Official build for OpenSuSE is discontinued. This is not a reflection of the technical

            <listitem>
                <para>Some minor aestethical update in command handling for report generation and
                        the addition of config settings for min/max battery voltage corresponding to
                        zero or full capacity as stated in the PDF report.
			In addition a number of tweaks to the PDF report as well as addition of the
			new commnd ".breport" (Basic-Report) to avoid querying the device for all
			its 50 possible geo-fence stored events. This makes it easier to generate
			a report over teh GPRS connection.

		<para> One important bug-fix was also the re-enabling of password protection for

            <listitem>
                <para>Adds option to include miniature maps in the various event mails that shows
                        the location. Also introduces throttling of Google API call to avoid hitting
                        the rate ceiling for anonymous call to Google. A notification mail is now
                        sent when the 24 hour limit has been reached and further lookups are
                        disabled until the 24 time period has expired, the daemon restarted or the
                        ".ratereset" command given. Some Improvements in handling of
                            <acronym>UTF8</acronym> characters have been added and pretty-printing
                        of tabled output introduced (see the ".table" command, <xref
                            linkend="cmd.srv-table"/>). A few more DB commands (db head, db tail)
                        and some minor bug fixes. Configuration file modified by adding possibility
                        to set a Google API key and moved the port settings to the "startup"
                        section. Improvements of the <command>dlrec</command> command and some
                        general documentation updates. Security audit for string routines and a
                        complete Coverity check. The communication with command shell was improved
                        to be able to send larger amount of data without truncation.</para>

                        command client to individually select which device to direct commands to.
                        One more highlight is the possibility to enter non-interactive commands via
                        the newly introduce "@@" command (See <xref

                        documentation was also overhauled to improve documentation build capability
                        on most common Linux variants as well as Apple OS X. The DB schema was also
                        slightly updated to include the approx street address. In addition some

        <para>In general the daemon is expected to initially have three to four public releases per
            year. However as it is also expected that as the product matures the updates will become
            less frequent. If critical issues with security implications are found then intermediate
            maintenance releases will issued. The daemon is considered stable with all planned
            features implemented. Future devlopment will primarily focus on making it easier to
            connect to the daemon from third party clients such as new Web clients or mobil
            clients</para>
