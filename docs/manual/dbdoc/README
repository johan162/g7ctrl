Database 

The received locations are stored in a SQLITE3 database. This directory contain the
documentation for the database structure.

DB Schema
=========
The DB schema consists of a trivial one-table sqlite3 DB. The column names describe
the obvious content in each column. The reason for not storing lat,lon as floats
is to avoid potential rounding errors.

The table was created with the following SQL:

CREATE TABLE tbl_track (
  'fld_key' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 
  'fld_timestamp' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_deviceid' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_datetime' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_lat' TEXT NOT NULL, 
  'fld_lon' TEXT NOT NULL, 
  'fld_approxaddr' TEXT NOT NULL, 
  'fld_speed' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_heading' INTEGER, NOT NULL,  
  'fld_altitude' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_satellite' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_event' INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  'fld_voltage' TEXT NOT NULL, 
  'fld_detachstat' INTEGER NOT NULL);

RNG Grammar
===========
The daemon can export the database in several formats. In addition to the standard
format as (i.e. GPX and KML) the database in its full can also be exported using
a custom XML schema which allows all information received to be included.

The Grammar for the XML schema is defined as a RNG grammar and available as

export_db.rng

or as a pictured grammar in
