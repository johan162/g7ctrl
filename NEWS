NEWS - Major releases
=====================
***Highlights major changes for each release in reverse chronological order.***

v3.4.1 (mar 2017)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------
Maintenance release and build environment update. The primary build environment
now uses gcc v5.4.0 (was 4.8.4) as well as fop v2.1 (was 1.1). The base for the
build server is now LTS release Ubunti 16.04 LTS (flavor Linux Mint 18.1 Serena)

The environment update has forced some minor code updates (primarily some
instrumentation to shut down false positive warning for use of C99 variable
length arrays on the stack (VLA). The move to fop 2.1 requires a configuration
file to set the proper base URI for inclusion of external objects (e.g. images in
the manual).

Adds some more information on cache usage in mail templates for tracking updates.
Some further minor internal changes only visible for developers.

Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
- Added cache reporting in the mail template

Bugs fixed
----------
- Reported absolute fill of cache was wrong after cache wraparound


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
- Avoid warning from clang compiler with pragma when -Wgnu-folding-constant is enabled
- Added '>>>' prefix for debug messages to make them more easy to spot in the log
- Added "fop.cfg" for use with fop invocation.
- Minor update to the build configuration script


v3.4.0 (maj 2016)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------
Minor maintenance release. Since the configuration file was updated with two
new settings to adjust the cache size the version was bumped to a new .dot release.
The focus of this release is primarily the geolocation cache handling with new 
features and one important bug fix. Statistics is now also kept when the
daemon is restarted.


Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
- Geolocation cache size is now adjustable in the configuration file by two new
  settings.
- Cache statistics will now be saved on exit and re-read upon start of the daemon.
- Minor visual adjustments of the PDF report layout
- Geolocation cache for addresses now creates an automatic backup of previously
  saved caches.
- Some more information on cache size and current usage is now shown in 
  the ".cachestat" server command.


Bugs fixed
----------
- Fixed a potential overflow if more cache locations was saved than we
  can read back at startup.
- The geolocation cache was not saved properly to file when terminating daemon
  when the cache index had wrapped around.


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
- Refactored the geo-location cache handling into its own module.
- Changed cache allocation from stack to heap
- the "mv_and_rename()" file function now accepts NULL argument for newname



v3.3.3 (dec 2015)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------
Happy X-mas! The last release for the year!

This release fixes one possible security issue. In the 3.x series it was not 
possible to enable the password for command login via the config file. It had 
no affect. A one-line check had been missing since the large refactoring in 
the 3.0.0 release. Some minor changes in the report layout was also made.


Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
 - User password for command login can now be enabled again (regression in 
   the 3.x series)
 - Some minor layout improvements in the PDF report.
 - Some minor update to mail template used for new connection
 

Bugs fixed
----------
 - Password could not be enabled for command connections. The setting in the
   config file were ignored.
 - The power saving section in the PDF report had an error in the status display
   for the wakeup report. It was also a bit too small.


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
 - Replaced some internal usage of unsafe string functions to corresponding
   safe versions in libxstr internal library.



v3.3.2 (nov 2015)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------

A minor maintenance release with some minor improvements in the handling of error
returns from the device and layout of the device report. In addition some internal 
changes were made to make the build fully compatible with the latest OS X 
release "El Capitan" (which felt the need to introduce some compatibility
breaks in the file system layout and permissions).

NOTE: Deprecation of support for OpenSuSE (and derivatives) based distributions.
As of this version no more active testing on those platforms will be made. 
From 3.4.0 all OpenSuSE specific control scripts will be removed (init.d/ scripts)

From this release and onwards a Debian/Ubuntu package is available at the 
PPA "ppa:johan162/g7ctrl" 


Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
 - Give better error message when the "test" command indicates error.
 - Add command ".breport" (Basic-report) which is almost the same as ".report"
   but does not include the geo-fence events in the report. This is useful if the
   report is generated over GPRS since it saves a lot of time since the report
   does not have to question the state of all 50 possible geo-fence events.
 - Minor change in the report layout to improve human readability of the to/from date 
   and time for stored locations.


Bugs fixed
----------
 - None (no reported bugs or remaining bugs in the backlog)


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
 - Retry up to a maximum of five times if we get a timeout from reading from 
   the device. However, that rarely seems to help once the device is in a non
   responsive mode. 
   If the device does not reply within a reasonable time no amount of re-reading 
   seems to succeed in reading back data. Instead the only way seems to be to
   flush the serial buffer and re-issue the command. 

 - Refactored rkey.[hc] to a proper dictionary API and renamed module to "dict"

 - Change the XSL stylesheet lookup to trust the current XML catalog instead of manually
   trying to locate the stylesheets in the config process. 
   This was originally a workaround for faulty installations with wrong catalog setup. 
   However, no more workarounds. If its broken you should fix your
   XML setup! This has the additional advantage of future proofing the Docbook build.

 - Minor updates to the bootstrap scripts to add the latest dependencies

 - Support for OpenSuSE and derivatives thereof is deprecated. This does not mean it 
   doesn't work. It just means that no more official testing will be done on those system.
   In addition this means that no more RPM packages will be built. The reason has 
   nothing to do with technical merits of the OpenSuSE platform but only as a mean
   to reduce the maintenance work. Starting with 3.4.0 all platform specific scripts
   (like init scripts to start the daemon) will also be removed since they will no
   longer be maintained.
   Version 3.4.0 and forward will only support Debian based derivatives (like Ubunto and
   Linux Mint)

 - Changed build options for GCC to include "--param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wstack-protector"
   which will decrease the default SSP limit of 8 down to 4 to make sure most functions
   using stack is protected.

 - Modify configuration process (configure.ac) so that an $prefix is not pre-prended
   to the DB directory in case the prefix is specified as either /usr or /usr/local
   Also fix a corner case when for bizarre setups the sysconfdir was not properly set.


v3.3.1 (oct 2015)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------

A minor release that just makes some aesthetical improvements to the ".report" 
command feedback. In addition there were some internal refactoring.

Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
 - Some minor change in command feedback when issuing the ".report" command
 - Ignore values from the GFEVT that couldn't be read in the report
 - Give a better error message when device is not connected when ".report" command
   is given.
 - Better support for generating report also over GPRS
 - Added user config value for min/max battery level in config file.

Bugs fixed
----------
  - None.


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
 - Moved extended string handling (xstr.*) and associative arrays to 
   separate extended string library "libxstr" under the src catalog.
 - Added semi-debug command ".freport" which takes the data in a static
   data file to generate the report instead of from the device.



v3.3.0 (oct 2015)
=================

General notes for this release
------------------------------

This release focus on providing the option to generate a device report. This is
a document that summarizes all settings for a connected device. The report is
generated in both PDF and JSON format. The PDF format is the primary format and
has some novel formatting and graphics to make it easier to get a quick overview 
of all the setting specified in the device. See the manual for examples.

Note: Since the configuration file have a new section the configuration file
should be installed from the distribution.


Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------

 - Added command ".report [file]" to generate a report

 - Added a new report section in the configuration file to control aspects
   of the report layout

-  Updated documentation with details about report and example PDF file


Bugs fixed
----------

 - The "phone" command did not allow the specification of report method and 
   VIP number.

 - The documentation for "phone" and "mswitch" command was wrong

 - The "gfen" command did not properly handle the enable/disable setting

 - The "gfevt" had the wrong number of arguments defined

 - abs() was used in gpsdist when it should have been fabs()



Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------

 - New dependency "libharu" (called "libhpdf-dev" in Ubunto/debian). 
   This is a generic PDF creation library.

 - Several new files that deals with the creation of the PDF device report
   They are divided between the view and model together with a supporting
   report utility library to make it easier to produce a table based report.

 - Added a module to manipulate associative arrays



v3.2.0 (may 2015)
========================

General notes for this release
------------------------------

This is a major feature release which increases functionality, stability and 
fine-tunes existing functionality in a number of areas. The details of the 
release can be found below. As a summary the highlights are: 

1. Option to include two static miniature maps with different zoom factors in 
   the various event notification mails that directly shows the location.

2. improvements in geolocation lookup for more robustness in terms of handling
   all possible returns from Google API calls and adapt to Google different 
   user limits in number of and frequency of API calls allowed.

3. context sensitive command completion have been introduced in the "g7sh"
   shell.

4. full UTF8 multi-byte string handling now supported for all server output. 

5. seven new server commands
    - **.date ** Prints current date and time on server
    - **.cachestat**  Prints statistics on the Geo-lcation caches
    - **.lookup** Toggles the address lookup for received locations
    - **db head** Print the *n* latest received location updates
    - **db tail** Print the *n* first received locations
    - **db sort** Controls the sorting order for the *db head* and *db tail*
    - **.table** Toggles the printing of pretty-printed tables

6. a number of new configuration options (in *g7config.conf*) to control the new
   features.

    - Specification of a Google API key which is used in the geolocation lookups.
      This allows the specification of a commercial key to increase the allowed
      number of calls (and rate/s) to Google location APIs.

      *More information about Google API key is available in the manual
      (see Appendix A.2 in the manual)*

    - A new setting (or actually settings) in the configuration file makes it
      possible to include two static mini-maps in the notification mails on event
      notifications for those event that carry a location. This is a small
      customizable static Google map centered around the current location of
      the tracker at two zoom levels (overview and detailed). The exact 
      zoom-levels used are customizable

    - A new setting to customize mail subject prefix

    - A new setting to choose to use a shorter form of device ID in subject header

-----
**NOTE:** Since the configuration file has been updated it is recommended to
install the new default config file and re-apply local config changes manually.

-----


Detailed user visible changes
-----------------------------
- Manual updated to RA15 to reflect changes in 3.2.0

- Added smart context sensitive command completion in the command shell 
  invoked by the tab-key

- Replaced "%" as command line prompt in shell with "g7ctrl>" and to "(arg)>> " 
  while in command arguments (second level).

- Mail templates updated with new look & feel

- The information in last location mail template has been updated to be in line
  with the other mail templates

- Added options "include_minimap" to enable the inclusion of a small static map
  showing the current location (with both an overview and a detailed map) the the
  notification mail. The exact meaning of these parameters are described in the
  manual and in the config file.

- Adds full UTF-8 support in order to better handle addresses from Google

- Added a new cache for the minimap images which are stored i the standard
  variable data files directory (defaults to /var/lib/g7ctrl) if not otherwise
  adjusted by the configuration. The same approximation as for the address
  is used.

- Added server command ".cachestat" to return statistics on cache hits and
  usage.

- Added server command ".date" to print server current date and time

- Added server command ".lookup" to toggle address lookup when storing
  locations in DB. Default value on startup is read from the configuration file.

- Added server command "db sort [arrival|device]" to specify sort order for
  "db head" and "db tail" commands. Only "db sort" prints the current sort order.

- Added "subject_prefix" setting the configuration file to allow customization
  of the prefix used in the subject header for all mails sent from the daemon.

- The calls to Google lookup API:s are now throttled not to exceed the rate
  limit for anonymous calls that Google enforces (5 QPS).
  It is (of course) still possible to exceed the "number of calls per 24 hour"
  (2500 calls/24h) and in that case you just have to wait.
  To avoid this it is strongly recommended to purchase an API commercial key.
  Using such a key will increase your Google allowances (10 QPS and 100,000
  queries/24h).  Such a key is personal and is requested directly from Google.
  A purchased or otherwise acquired key can be specified in the configuration file.

- Handle 24h absolute rate limit for Google APIs. If the 24h rate limit (for
  total number of API calls) is reached  then no further Google API calls are
  made until 24h has passed. This can be reset
  manually with the new ".ratereset" command. If the rate limit is hit then a
  notification email is also sent. Restarting the daemon will also reset the
  blockage.

- Introduced option to set a Google API key in the configuration file to allow
  for higher rate and higher absolute number of address lookups. To get a key
  you must configure a key in the Google administration console as described in
  Appendix A.2

- Moved port settings in config file from "config" to "startup" section since
  ports will not be changed in the running daemon even if the config file is
  refreshed.

- Search for the chosen compression program in several locations
  and give better error message if not found when trying to mail a
  compressed version of the DB.

- Add server command ".table" to output result tables in nicer unicode table.
  The command itself toggles this option for the connected client.
  This affects all command with tabled output such as ".usb",".target",".ld"
  and so on.

  For example:

        % .table
        Table drawing : On
        % .target
        ╒════╤════════════════╤══════════════════╤════════════╕
        │  # │       IP       │      Status      │   Dev ID   │
        ╞════╪════════════════╪══════════════════╪════════════╡
        │ 01 │ *79.102.220.42 │ 2015-03-05 20:06 │ 3000000001 │
        └────┴────────────────┴──────────────────┴────────────┘

- Improved geo -location lookup. If a location does not have a street address
  then see if it has a at least a postal code and in that case return that
  before giving up.

- Added two DB commands "db tail" and "db head" which displays a list of location
  updates from the head or tail of the location table. Only the key fields
  position, timestamp, address, speed and device id fields are displayed.
  The list is sorted depending on the setting from the "db sort" command. By
  default the sort order is by time of arrival. The oldest
  location in the DB has number 1 and the newest the highest number (=equal the
  number of locations in the DB).

  The newest location (according to the specified sort order) is always at the
  top. The sort order can be set to either "by arrival" or "by timestamp". See
  the "db sort" command.

  For example:

        % db head
        0002  2014-12-11 00:57:07 3000000001 61.478771 15.382076 0   "828 93, Sweden"
        0001  2014-12-11 00:22:25 3000000001 57.478771 16.382076 0   "Skälsebo Målehorva 2, 572 96 Fårbo, Sweden"

  Or with pretty printing enabled

        % .table
        Table drawing : On
        % db head
        ╔════╤═══════════════════╤══════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════╤══════════════════════════════════════════╗

        ╚════╧═══════════════════╧══════════╧═════════╧═════════╧═════╧══════════════════════════════════════════╝



Bugs fixed
----------

- Fix handling of GFEN command to show all arguments. This also changes behavior so
  that it is no longer possible to only use the "set gfen on" as a shortcut.

- Fixed a bug where device replies for commands with no reply argument was not
  properly received.  

- The CSS tag for bold fonts in email template "mail_event.html" was wrong.

- The memcpy() used strlcpy() would read too much memory for short strings. This
  would never cause a buffer overwrite error but could be reading non-accessible
  memory and result in a **SIGSEGV**.

- The field labels in the last location mail template was wrong


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers)
-------------------------------------------------------
- New location for the repository 
  https://sourceforge.net/p/g7ctrl/git/

- Moved to Git based repository from 3.2.0 and hence all SVN tags
  has been removed.

- Renamed geolocation_google.[hc] to geoloc.[hc]

- The modules "unicode_tbl.[ch]" was added which manage the table formatting
  in a nice and easy way.

- The daemon now initializes setlocale(LC_ALL,"") to read the current locale
  since it will be needed for correctly handling of UTF8 code points.

- In XML doc sources start replacing xlink:href with linkend

- Added some more detailed error messages to better diagnose what Google is
  returning as street address (or not).

- Some internal changes to DB location list handling

- Generic improvements in handling of UTF8 encoded chars
   - Added xmb_strncpy() in xstr.c as a UTF8 safe version of strncpy()
   - Refactored all internal usage of strncpy() to use UTF8 safe version as applicable
     as well as buffer and security audit of all usages.
   - Added UTF8 safe versions of printf() and fprintf() to properly format strings with
     size specifiers such as "%-30s" xmb_printf(), and xmb_fprintf()
   - Added xmb_strncat()


- For OSX an approximation of clock_gettime() POSIX call has been added in the
  utils module.

- Increased a number of buffers used with the socket communication to be able to
  handle larger amount of data in the g7 shell before truncating and giving an
  error.

- The built in SMTP library has received some better documentation and some
  new utility methods to simplify handling of non-file based images that should
  be included as inline pictures.

- The mailutil library has also got new supporting functionality to work with
  images that are inline and not included as attachments.

- If the system uses logrotate the installation will now install a configuration
  script in /etc/logrotate.d . NOTE since the logfile could be a runtime setting
  it might need adjustment if a non standard location is used for the logfile.
  The logrotate script assumes that the logfile is "/var/log/g7ctrl/g7ctrl.log"

- The README files and other text info files have been made compatible with
  markdown syntax

- The created file for source statistics in the manual is removed from the
  repo since it is a constructed file and updates on a make of the manual.
  The stats are now created from the makefile in the docs/manual directory.



g7ctrl v3.1.0 (march 2015)
==========================

General notes for this release
------------------------------
**This release bring some notable new features:**

1. Each connected client can now independently have different connected devices.
   In previous releases all clients talked to the same device when issuing
   commands and if one client changed the target the other clients were also
   changed since the target device was a server setting.

2. The server can now manage several connected devices over USB and the
   client can select which of the connected USB devices to talk to.
   In addition when a USB device is connected the ID of the device is read
   and first after the ID has been successfully read is the device available
   for commands.

3. The last feature that will allow the user to specify a proximity range for
   when the location lookup should match an existing address. The proximity is
   specified as a new value (in meters) in the config file.
   Since the accuracy of the GPS is rarely better than 15 meters it is
   un-necessary to send a request to Google if the location is only different
   in the last digit or so in the received coordinates. The distance calculation
   uses the "Haversine" method (Great circle) to calculate the distance between
   two locations.

4. Summary of new/modified commands introduced in this release
   Server commands:

    * .target     - List/Set device target connected over GPRS
    * .usb        - List/Set device target connected on a USB port
    * .ld         - List all connected devices
    * -lc         - List all connected command clients

    Device commands:

    * get address - Return approx. street address for current location
    * @@CMD(arg1,arg2, ...) New syntax to give non-interactive commands


User visible changes:
---------------------
- Manual updated to RA13 to cover all new additions in 3.1.0

- A new command "get address" was  introduced which will get the latest
  location from the device as a street address.

- It is now possible to enter non-interactive commands with the syntax
  @@CMD(arg1,arg2,...)
  Example: @@LED(1)
  The syntax is the exact same as how presets are specified. This makes
  it faster to enter more complex command for experienced user by bypassing
  the question/answer process when using the ordinary command entering process.
  This is further documented in the manual.

- The new command ".target" replaces the old ".use" to specify which device
  should receive the commands. This targets a device connected over GPRS

- The new server command ".usb" is used to specify which USB port to talk
  to in case multiple devices are connected. It is also used to list devices
  currently connected on USB

- The ".lc" behavior is modified to only list command connections

- The new server command ".ld" is used to list connected devices over both
  USB and GPRS

- Each command client now have an individual connection state so each connected
  client can talk to a different device

- Multiple USB devices can be connected and managed

- The device ID of connected devices over USB is read upon connection. NOTE
  this also introduces a slight delay which also better indicates the time it
  tales for the device to establish a USB serial simulation so the device ID
  can be read back. It takes about 20s for the device to set up .

- Added "address_lookup_proximity" config setting to allow setting how close a
  cache match must be in order to be considered a match for a cached street address.

- Allow multiple commands in the same string for batch shell processing with
  "g7sh -e". Commands are separated with a ";" character
  For example: g7sh -e ".ver;db size;db mailcsv;"
  Commands with arguments are not yet supported.

- Updated documentation to reflect changes in 3.1.0. Updated troubleshooting
  guide and some more code statistics in the technical appendix.

- Some minor esthetic updates:
   - Extra blank line in reply after listing preset removed
   - Extra blank line in reply after sending mail with exported db removed
   - Title in mails sent on on new device connection and events harmonized

- Some minor updates of default values in the config file

- The timeout value for receiving command replies over GPRS was increased
  since it sometimes take up to 30s to receive a reply.


Bugs fixed:
-----------
- A number of theoretical buffer overruns was fixed (detected by Coverity scan)

- The translation to human readable text would always show "Off" for binary
  commands.

- The translation of the device error code to human text was incorrect for the
  case when the command name was not included in the reply (as the protocol
  specification wrongly states it always should be.)

- On some occasions the assumption was made that basename() does not change
  its argument (glibc - style since the code is built with _GNU_SOURCE defined).
  Unfortunately this is an incorrect assumption if both libgen.h and string.h
  is included in the same *.c file even if _GNU_SOURCE is defined!

- If the g7shell was terminated with Ctrl-C then the terminal could be left
  in a confused state and require a "reset" due to readline() signal
  handling not being properly cleaned up.

- A few minor spelling errors in comments and docs was fixed


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers):
--------------------------------------------------------
- The xstrsplitfields() function has changed behavior so that it will
  preserve spaces in the split strings.

- Added buffer overrun checks in xstrsplitfields() for extra safety

- The signature for the geodetic distance calculations functions have been
  updated to reflect there const'ness

- Renamed worker.[ch] -> socklistener.[ch]

- Some major refactoring in all command methods due to the need to include
  the client context which is unique for each command thread.

- A new structure usb_conn_status have ben introduced to keep track of multiple
  USB devices.



g7ctrl v3.0.0 (jan 2015)
========================

**General notes for this release**
-----------------------------------
The bump in full version number is made necessary since the config file
and startup option has changed and potentially breaks the backwards
compatibility with existing installation scripts by packager.

This release also changes the location for various data files to better
adhere to FHS.

This is good thing but potential packagers need to be aware of this even
though it should make things simpler in the long run.


User visible changes:
---------------------
- Make the daemon reload config and preset files on receiving signal SIGHUP

- Removed the daemonize config setting from the config file. It makes more sense to
  only have this as a program option handled by a system administrator at install time.

- The directories for the data files has been changed to better adherence to FHS.
  This means that :
    a) The static datafiles (templates etc.) are moved to /usr/share/g7ctrl
    b) The default data files that change (i.e. DB files) is now moved to /var/lib/g7ctrl
    c) The default PID lock file is in /var/run/g7ctrl
    d) The default logfile is in /var/log/g7ctrl
    e) The default config file location remains in /etc/g7ctrl
  These locations can be overridden by program options at start of the daemon using
  the new options --pidfile , --datadir, --dbdir

- The db_dir and logfile locations are removed from the config file since this is
  more correctly a packaging setting and now has to be overridden by program
  options. This also makes it possible to reload config file on the fly when we receive
  the SIGHUP signal.

- Added JSON export format for DB.

- When exporting the DB to chosen format there is no longer any imposed size restriction
  other than available memory.

- Don't install the g7m emulator for regular builds but only for development builds
  it does not make sense for regular users to have this.


Bugs fixed:
-----------
- The mail handling can now be completely disabled with the config setting "use_mail"
  Previously this setting was ignored.

- The upstart script (for Debian based distributions) was using "expect fork" when
  it needs an "expect dameon" since we fork exactly twice to avoid becoming session leader.
  This error made "stop g7ctrl" give an error since the wrong PID was registered
  by upstart.

- If translation to human labels on receiving device replies was enabled then the reply
  from the server would erronous indicate an error in the device reply.


Internal changes (visible for developers and packagers):
--------------------------------------------------------
- Use the system log directory by default, i.e. "/var/log" and handle permission
  accordingly when we drop down.

- The lockfile handling has been completely rewritten to better adhere to
  best practice. This also means that the daemon accepts and extra command
  line argument "-z" to optionally specify where to store a lockfile.
  NOTE1: This is now mandatory if the daemon is not started as root!
  NOTE2: When started as root the lockfile is always stored in "/var/run/g7ctrl/g7ctrl.pid"

- By configuring with "--enable-stacktrace" this will now force gcc to use the
  "-rdynamic" flag to be able to include the symbol tables so that the stacktrace
  directly can give better human information. In addition enabling the stacktrace
  is interpretated as a development build and will also build the emulator.

- Added utility build script "dbgconfig.sh" to configure a development build.

- The automake file for installing assets like templates has been rewritten to
  make it clearer and rely more on the built in magic of autotools

- Added utility build scripts ststbuild,sh and ststrun.sh to build and install
  in a system test directory for development purposes using the make staging
  with DESTDIR
