# Readme

This package contains a Unix/Linux service (a.k.a. daemon) that is intended to
be used together with the GM7 GPS Tracker. The daemon has primarily two functions.

1. Listen on a specified TCP/IP port (the device port) for location and event
   reports sent by the tracker. For details on the operation of the daemon see
   man (1) g7ctrl. All Event received by the daemon are stored in an
   sqlite3 database.

2. Control and configure the tracker over either a USB cable connection or a
   GPRS link.

The daemon supports both the full command set of the GM7 tracker as well as a
rich set of commands to control the dameon itself and manipulate the received
locations updates.

To interact with the dameon the package also comes with a command shell
*g7sh* which supports full line editing capabilities and easy access to the
daemon. See man (1) g7sh for more information.
