This is a list of features planned as backlog activities in reverse chronological order.


Planned for v4.1.0 [NOT STARTED]
--------------------------------
TAGLINE: 

Backlog:
- Establish infrastructure for localization of messages
- Verify that device connected is really GM7 tracker (by checking sysfs  
  information /sys/class/tty/.. for model id and manufacturer) 
- Improved USB handling (detection of GM7 device using manufacturer and device iD)
- Add /udev rules to detect GM7 device automatically instead of inotify()
  Device seems to use the following settings:

- <empty>

Done:
- Add json DB export option to documentation
- Add documentation of new config options in relation to minimaps
- Code cleanup and coverity check
- Add documentation for ".cachestat"
- Add option to include a minimap in the notification mail on where the
  tracker currently is in order to avoid having to follow the link to Google.
- Add documentation in the manual for Google API key handling and application
- Add missing doc for config options
- Add unicode drawing of tables for nice output
- Handle system with binaries for compression program in non-standard locations
- Document .table command
- Investigate why we cannot parse Gelookup for address:
  Geocache MISS (59.478771,15.382076)
  ** Failed to parse service reply for address (lat=59.478771, lon=15.382076)
  ** Reverse geolocation lookup failed for (59.478771,15.382076)
  (Resolved: Does not have a street address)
- Add option to print head of last positions in DB to screen
- Add proper table output for db head and db tail
- Rework all table output to only use unitable module
- Check that address lookup can be used when importing locations over USB from
  device.
- Add Google API key to config file
- Improve capacity to handle large data sent back from the server to the shell
- Add command ".ratereset"
- Add mail notification when 24 API limit has been reached


Planned for v3.1.0 [**COMPLETED]
--------------------------------
Backlog:
- <empty>

Done:
- Update documentation for new ".target", ".lc" and ".ld" commands.
- Change the .use command. Proposed new syntax
  ".target x"    to connect to target device at usb index 'x'
                 the index can be ssen by listing all connected
  ".usb x"       USB devices with command ".ld"
                 The default when a command client is connected
                 will be "usb 0" (The first connected device)
- Do a clean exit in GNU readline if the shell is terminated by user with C-C
- Make device target a per client setting (larger refactoring)
- Make it possible to handle multiple USB client connected to the server
- Make the .lc command only list command clients
- Add .ld command that only lists connected device and shows the active connection
- Updated docs and help texts
- Accept multiple device commands on command line with the '-e' option
- Store the geocache on file when the daemon shuts down
- Add automatically updated code statistics in technical section of the manual
- Add information about the Geo cache saved file
- Update utility build script documentation
- Add reading Dev ID for OSX version of connect agent
- (remove .ld and replace with .target without argument in analogue with how .usb works
- Investigate feasibility to switch ports on account on receiving SIGHUP 
  Conclusion: Not worth the extra complexity. Change of listening ports will require restart
  of daemon.
- Add help for new .usb and .target commands for the online "help"
- Add documentation for "@@" non-interactive functions
- Add command "get address" which is similar to "get loc" but will return 
  the corresponding street address as returned by Google maps for the
  current location.
- Add option to specify commands with argument to the "-e" option for command 
  shell to allow its use in off-line batch processing.
- Add documentation for multiple USB

Planned for v2.2.0 [**COMPLETED]

         text.

Backlog:
 - <empty>

Done:
- Make it possible to have finer select which records are exported and mailed as 
  attachment on date and/or device id
- More consistent handling of command reply
- Clean up command sending/receiving
- Communicate TO device over GPRS
- Add automatic tagging of commands to recognize proper responses
- Document ".use"
- Add detailed help for all server commands
- Add optional interpretation of command replies so that for example the reply
  get lowbatt, "0,0" translates to :
       Report action: Disable
            VIP Mask: 0
- Add preset templates for power management
- Run through Coverity and fix warnings




Planned for v2.0.1 [**COMPLETED]
--------------------------------
TAGLINE: Optimize DB, nick names, add geo fence event command and fix all
remaining standard commands. Under the hood preparation for 
communication to device over GPRS.


Backlog:
- <empty>

Done:
- Add command ".lc" - List active connections
- Optimize DB storage
- Add option to connect a nick-name to a specific device id which is used in
  for example mail and DB exports

  track-segments in GPX export

    "get batt" = Get battery voltage
- Sort "help" commands
- Refactor download of locations
- Refactor mid level read from device
- Refactor nick name handling
- Implement gfevt
- Make it possible to specify usage of xz or gz compression for mailing GPX file
  in config.
- Improve build handling on systems not having "links" installed
- GPRS: If new incoming connection is from a device that has an old connection
  remove old connection immediately (without waiting for it to timeout)
- Check DB version
- Dynamic IP address for device is kept up to date when GPRS connection exists
  this is the first half of handling commands over GPRS.
- Design and add geofence numbered events handling
